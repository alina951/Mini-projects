HOW and WHEN  to use while loop?
whenever we have something to use multiple times/repetition we use while loop.
HOW TO STRUCTURE IT?
1: always start with varible i = 1 (its called initialization)
2: write while i <= 5:   (have to give condition to make it works)
3: i = i+1 (each time value will increase called increment or decrement according to your question)


"FOR LOOP" It works for sequence such as list, tuple and sets.
WHAT IS THE SYNTAX?
x = ['ryan', 31, 1.8] (for loop will print everything one by one)
for i in x: (dont forget to use indentation)
print(i)

" if , else example "  
x = 5
r = x % 2
if (r==0):
    print("even ")
if (r==1):               here we had to use if twice we can improve it by using "else" 
        print("odd")
print ("bye")    


or
x = 7
r = x % 2
if (r==0):
    print("even ")        here i used same example but with else.
    if x>5:
         print("ok")
else:  
      print("odd")
print ("bye")
