JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for data exchange between a server and a web application. Here are some key reasons we use JSON:

Human-readable: JSON format is straightforward and easy to understand.
Language-independent: JSON can be used with many programming languages, including Python.
Structured: JSON allows us to store complex data structures like lists and dictionaries in a standardized format.
In this script, JSON is used to save and load the lists of products and couriers from text files, which makes it easy to persist data between runs of the program.
